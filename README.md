# Abstract

This is a an exercise is using Power Query to combine Polarion data into a report that can demonstrate how requirements relate to one another. 

# Background

## Requirement Relationships

The requirements are in three bins:

* User Needs<br>These requirements describe the product with respect to what its users must do for it to perform its functions.
* Test Plans<br>These test plans detail how each user need will be tested in order to demonstrate conformance.
* Test Reports<br>These are the test results that demonstrate that the product meet the user needs.

The relationships being showns are User Needs → Test Plans → Test Report.

## Process

The user needs, test plans, and test report data is all obtained from Polarion exports (.xlsx files). This is not the ideal way to obtain this data, but we have had no training on how to query directly within Polarion.
